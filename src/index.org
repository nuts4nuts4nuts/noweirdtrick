* No Weird Trick

#+begin_quote
Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

- Arthur C. Clarke, /Profiles of the Future/, 1962

When I first heard Clarke's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws][third law]], I thought science-fiction.
Clarke was a science fiction author after all.
I imagined humanity interacting with Aliens and finding them incomprehensible.
But the quote doesn't say "alien technology" or "future technology" - just "sufficiently advanced."
Sufficiently advanced is so personal.

For babies, object permanence is sufficiently advanced.
For me, electricity is sufficiently advanced.
I live with it, I am comfortable with it, but I don't understand it - it may as well be magic to me.

...


There is no weird trick.
